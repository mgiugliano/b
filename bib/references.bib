Like all MAGUK-family proteins, its basic structure includes three PDZ domains, an IH3 domain, and a guanylate kinse-like domain (GK).

It is almost exclusively located in the post synaptic density of neurons, and is involved in anchoring synaptic proteins.

Its direct and indirect binding partners include neuroligin, NMDA Receptor, AMPA Receptor, and Potassium channels.}}
